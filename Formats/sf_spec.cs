This is particularly useful for percussive instruments such as a hi-hat cymbal. An exclusive class value of zero indicates no exclusive class; no special action is taken. Any other value indicates that when this note is initiated, any other sounding note with the same exclusive class value should be rapidly terminated. The exclusive class generator can only appear at the instrument level. The scope of the exclusive class is the entire preset. In other words, any other instrument zone within the same preset holding a corresponding exclusive class will be terminated.

For example, if the sample were a recording of a piano middle C (Original Key = 60) at a sample rate of 22.050 kHz, and Root Key were set to 69, then playing MIDI key number 69 (A above middle C) would cause a piano note of pitch middle C to be heard.
